                and for the termination of users of our online Site who are
                repeated infringers of intellectual property rights, including
                copyrights. If you believe that one of our users is, through the

                work, and wish to have the allegedly infringing material
                removed, the following information in the form of a written
                notification (pursuant to 17 U.S.C. § 512(c)) must be provided

                that you claim is infringing and that you request us to remove;
                sufficient information to permit us to locate such material;
                your address, telephone number, and e-mail address; a statement
                that you have a good faith belief that use of the objectionable
                material is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or
                under the law; and a statement that the information in the
                notification is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that you

                infringed or that you are authorized to act on behalf of the

                nature and basis of the claim or dispute, and the requested
                relief. A Notice to the Company should be sent to: s/o Lt
                Narendra Ch Gupta, 6 IGM Hospital Lane, AGARTALA West Tripura TR
                799001 . After the Notice is received, you and the Company may
                attempt to resolve the claim or dispute informally. If you and
                the Company do not resolve the claim or dispute within thirty
                (30) days after the Notice is received, either party may begin
                an arbitration proceeding. The amount of any settlement offer
                made by any party may not be disclosed to the arbitrator until
                after the arbitrator has determined the amount of the award to
                which either party is entitled.

                Arbitration Rules. Arbitration shall be initiated through the
                American Arbitration Association, an established alternative
                dispute resolution provider that offers arbitration as set forth
                in this section. If AAA is not available to arbitrate, the
                parties shall agree to select an alternative ADR Provider. The
                rules of the ADR Provider shall govern all aspects of the
                arbitration except to the extent such rules are in conflict with
                the Terms. The AAA Consumer Arbitration Rules governing the
                arbitration are available online at adr.org or by calling the
                AAA at 1-800-778-7879. The arbitration shall be conducted by a
                single, neutral arbitrator. Any claims or disputes where the
                total amount of the award sought is less than Ten Thousand U.S.
                Dollars (US $10,000.00) may be resolved through binding
                non-appearance-based arbitration, at the option of the party
                seeking relief. For claims or disputes where the total amount of
                the award sought is Ten Thousand U.S. Dollars (US $10,000.00) or
                more, the right to a hearing will be determined by the
                Arbitration Rules. Any hearing will be held in a location within
                100 miles of your residence, unless you reside outside of the
                United States, and unless the parties agree otherwise. If you
                reside outside of the U.S., the arbitrator shall give the
                parties reasonable notice of the date, time and place of any
                oral hearings. Any judgment on the award rendered by the
                arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent
                jurisdiction. If the arbitrator grants you an award that is
                greater than the last settlement offer that the Company made to
                you prior to the initiation of arbitration, the Company will pay
                you the greater of the award or $2,500.00. Each party shall bear
                its own costs and disbursements arising out of the arbitration
                and shall pay an equal share of the fees and costs of the ADR
                Provider.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p>
                Additional Rules for Non-Appearance Based Arbitration. If
                non-appearance based arbitration is elected, the arbitration
                shall be conducted by telephone, online and/or based solely on
                written submissions; the specific manner shall be chosen by the
                party initiating the arbitration. The arbitration shall not
                involve any personal appearance by the parties or witnesses
                unless otherwise agreed by the parties.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p>
                Time Limits. If you or the Company pursues arbitration, the
                arbitration action must be initiated and/or demanded within the
                statute of limitations and within any deadline imposed under the
                AAA Rules for the pertinent claim.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p>
                Authority of Arbitrator. If arbitration is initiated, the
                arbitrator will decide the rights and liabilities of you and the
                Company, and the dispute will not be consolidated with any other
                matters or joined with any other cases or parties. The
                arbitrator shall have the authority to grant motions dispositive
                of all or part of any claim. The arbitrator shall have the
                authority to award monetary damages, and to grant any
                non-monetary remedy or relief available to an individual under
                applicable law, the AAA Rules, and the Terms. The arbitrator
                shall issue a written award and statement of decision describing
                the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is
                based. The arbitrator has the same authority to award relief on
                an individual basis that a judge in a court of law would have.
                The award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and
                the Company.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p>
                Waiver of Jury Trial. THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE THEIR
                CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO GO TO COURT AND HAVE A
                TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY, instead electing that all
                claims and disputes shall be resolved by arbitration under this
                Arbitration Agreement. Arbitration procedures are typically more
                limited, more efficient and less expensive than rules applicable
                in a court and are subject to very limited review by a court. In
                the event any litigation should arise between you and the
                Company in any state or federal court in a suit to vacate or
                enforce an arbitration award or otherwise, YOU AND THE COMPANY
                WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL, instead electing that the
                dispute be resolved by a judge.
              </p>
              <br />

              <p>
                Waiver of Class or Consolidated Actions. All claims and disputes
                within the scope of this arbitration agreement must be
                arbitrated or litigated on an individual basis and not on a
                class basis, and claims of more than one customer or user cannot
                be arbitrated or litigated jointly or consolidated with those of
                any other customer or user.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p>
                Confidentiality. <br /> All aspects of the arbitration
                proceeding shall be strictly confidential. The parties agree to
                maintain confidentiality unless otherwise required by law. This
                paragraph shall not prevent a party from submitting to a court
                of law any information necessary to enforce this Agreement, to
                enforce an arbitration award, or to seek injunctive or equitable
                relief.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p>
                Severability. <br /> If any part or parts of this Arbitration
                Agreement are found under the law to be invalid or unenforceable
                by a court of competent jurisdiction, then such specific part or
                parts shall be of no force and effect and shall be severed and
                the remainder of the Agreement shall continue in full force and
                effect.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p>
              Right to Waive. Any or all of the rights and limitations set forth in this Arbitration Agreement may be waived by the party against whom the claim is asserted.  Such waiver shall not waive or affect any other portion of this Arbitration Agreement.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p>Survival of Agreement. This Arbitration Agreement will survive the termination of your relationship with Company.
